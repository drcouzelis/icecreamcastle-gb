Notes
* Do not disable the screen with every frame, it literally turn off the screen and leaves a "white" frame.
* Use the V-Blank interrupt for timing the main game loop.
* OAM must be cleared before use. It is filled with garbage at boot.
* DMA is a process that allows fast transfer of graphics from ROM to OAM without needing to use the CPU. It isn't needed but it's useful.
* It is custom to read the key input and arrange them in a byte, high-to-low, in this order: Down, Up, Left, Right, Start, Select, B, A.
* It is custom to clear the reading of input, although it may not be needed. (load P1F_GET_NONE into [rP1])
* Set a breakpoint with "ld b, b"
* Make changes to OAM as soon as VBlank starts so you don't run out of time!
* Consider doing updates in this order: VRAM -> Palettes -> DMA -> Input

Conventions
* Labels use PascalCase
* Labels in VRAM, SRAM, WRAM, HRAM use PascalCase with a v/s/w/h prefix
* Local labels use .camelCase
* Macro names use snake_case
* Constants use CAPS_SNAKE
* Constants posing as labels should look like a label

Subpixels! Aka fixed-point math
If you want a speed of 3 pixels over 4 frames, you want a speed of 3/4 (= 0.75) pixels/frame
To achieve this smoothly, you need to track positions at a precision greater than one pixel
Since floating-point integers are way overkill for this, you can instead use fixed-point math
Fixed-point is very easy: you take a number, and simply trim off some digits
For example, in "3.4" decimal fixed-point, I you would write 0.75 as "0007500"
3 digits, then an implied comma, then the fractional part
How comfortable are you with scientific notation and math? It could simplify the explanation

Fixed-point math is literally nothing more than plain integer math

8.8 fixed point math should be relatively straight forward
cuz then you have a "pixel" byte and a "subpixel" byte so to speak

An extra byte is overkill; 12.4 is typically more adapted for GB
(2048 pixel range, 16 subpixels/pixel)

Starting at position 0, over 4 frames, the position would be:
- 0.75
- 1.5
- 2.25
- 3
So the player would appear to
- Not move
- Move
- Move
- Move
The upside is that this works even for more complicated fractions (try implementing a speed of 3/8 pixels/frame using timers), and also works seamlessly if the speed changes (typically, running)
It's also typically at least as good as using timers, both in terms of code written and performance
